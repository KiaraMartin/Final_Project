# Final Project

This is the final project of Kiara Martin for the Peckham Digital Accelerator Zone: Introduction to Data Science course. 

I will be comparing annual sunshine and rainfall data in England from 2015-2024 from (https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/uk-and-regional-series) against annual chlamydia diagnoses in people aged 15 to 24 years in England between 2015 to 2024 data from (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables/sexually-transmitted-infections-and-screening-for-chlamydia-in-england-2024-report), in attempts to identify a possible correlation between the two datasets.
